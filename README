CommieCC (Commie Classroom Controller)
--------------------------------------

CommieCC (stands for Commie Classroom Controller) helps to manage the common 
tasks on a computer classroom: 

* Discover computers
* Lock/unlock screen
* Close session, reboot and halt

It provides a GUI for monitoring and managing the computers and has a 
plugin-able architecture so the actions can be easily extended.
